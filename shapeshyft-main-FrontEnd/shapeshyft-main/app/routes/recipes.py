Combine ground meat or vegieburger, egg, and parsely, the consistancy of the mixture is kinda loose. Drop in small pieces of the meat mixture, not much larger than a Tablespoon. (making tiny meatballs.) Turn up the heat and bring to a boil,5 -7 minutes, it is ready when the little meatballs float to the surface.","Heat oven to 425 degrees. Grease 12-inch pizza pan or 13x9-inch pan; sprinkle with cornmeal. Unroll dough; press into greased pan. In small bowl, combine oil and garlic; drizzle over dough. Top evenly with mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil and oregano. Bake at 425 for 13-16 minutes or until crust is deep golden brown.

Then take out of the oven, let it cool. And it is ready to eat. And in the meantime, here's my recipe (I think I had the most spelling errors of the whole class!).","Put flour in food processor bowl and add eggs. Blend for a few seconds. Scrape sides of work bowl and blend a few more seconds. Add vegetable oil and salt. Blend into flour mixture. While processor is running, add water in a slow stream. When dough forms a ball, it is ready. If a ball does not form, add 1 Tablespoon of water at a time until it does form a ball. (Do not let the dough get too gummy. If this does happen, take the dough out of the processor and lnead in a little more flour.) When the dough forms a ball, take it out of the processor and knead a few minutes in flour, form into a ball, cover with a bowl and let rest at least 20 minutes. Cut small fistfulls of dough off, pound out with your fist, and run through the pasta machine. Yield: 4 to 6 servings. BECKY MC KINNEY (MRS. RICHARD H., JR.)","1. In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil. 2. When the oil is hot, render the Tasso for 2 minutes. 3. Add the shallots and crawfish and saute for 1 minute. 4. Stir in the garlic, tomatoes, and green onions, saute for 1 minute. 5. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. 6. Stir in the cream and bring up to a boil. 7. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 4-6 minutes or until the sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon. 8. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. 9. Stir the butter into the sauce. 10. Add the pasta to the pan and gently toss the pasta into the sauce. 11. Garnish the pasta with the grated cheese and chives. Note: Yields: 4 appetizer servings."]
